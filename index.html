        </h2>
        <p class = "centerMainText">
            Create: Civilization is a Create-based SMP with the goal of being an SMP with a strong player base with rich and eventful player interactions that will set it apart from other SMPs. Our aim is to give players all the tools they need to acheive this, whether it be through wonders of engineering or weapons of war.<br> The SMP will be set within a 1/500 scale recreation of Earth. Interactions between factions such as trade, and occasionally war are encouraged. With the ability to create tracks, wheels, wings, and everything in between, as well as to equip various armaments, we are excited to see what everyone comes up with!
